# scripts

This repo contains various python scrpits that I created just for fun.

Description:

<1> Word-Master.py - Don't bother, it's nothing. It just takes a random word from word_master.txt and present it to user and wait for the their response. I made this to help my friend who was preparing for an exam and he needed a system to test his vocabulary.

<2> amaz-mech.py - This one is I'm particularly proud of. This is kind of my first original work. What you have to do is - edit the script with your email and password of your Amazon(India) account and the link of the product that you want to order on Amazon(India). Run the script and it will place order for you using Cash On Delivery as a payment method given that you already have provided a delivery address in your account.
This script can be particularly useful in the situations where people order same thing again and again.
One more thing, someone pointed out to me that my code is really bad. So, if someone can make it better, that would be great.
